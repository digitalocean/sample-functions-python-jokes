# Sample Function: Python Joke API

## Introduction

This repository contains a sample joke API function written in Python. You can deploy it on DigitalOcean's App Platform as a Serverless Function component.
Documentation is available at https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/functions.

### Requirements

* You need a DigitalOcean account. If you don't already have one, you can sign up at [https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new).
* To deploy from the command line, you will need the [DigitalOcean `doctl` CLI](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl/releases).

## Deploying the Function

```
# clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:digitalocean/sample-functions-python-jokes.git
```

```
# deploy the project, using "remote-build" so that the build and runtime environments match
> doctl serverless deploy sample-functions-python-jokes --remote-build
Deploying 'sample-functions-python-jokes'
  to namespace 'fn-...'
  on host 'https://faas-...'
Submitted action 'joke' for remote building and deployment in runtime python:default
Processing of 'joke' is still running remotely ...
...
Deployed functions ('doctl sbx fn get <funcName> --url' for URL):
  - joke
```

```
# execute the function
> doctl serverless functions invoke joke/joke
{
  "body": {
    "response_type": "in_channel",
    "text": "Waiter: He's choking! Is anyone a doctor? Programmer: I'm a Vim user."
  }
}
```

Note the CLI command can be abbreviated as `doctl sls fn invoke joke/joke`.
